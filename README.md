# Unity Hand Tracking for AR/VR applications (Android)
### Overview & Agenda:
A sub-project for implementing hand tracking in mobile phones (Android) for AR/VR application (The main project being **The Haptic Response Glove**) using **MediaPipe**. **MediaPipe** is a multinodal machine learning pipeline developed by Google. It has various features ranging from Keypoint prediction to face detection. 
### A walk through of working:
1. Let ARFoundation detect the nearest plane.
2. Push your hand on the detected plane and press **OK** button so that MediaPipe can track accurate depth of your hand w.r.t the phone.
3. By this step your hand must be tracked !
